# PBRT-Learning
I change it to a Qt version just because I want to see the images directly, and maybe it needs to be compiled by Visual Studio. You need to change the Qt version after opening the .sln file.

Since the second part continues the first part, so there is only a final project of the second part. And since the third part refactors the second part a lot, I separate them.

Besides, I found there are errors when I put some functions just in header files, so I added many sources files.

Next, I want to try to use this frame to open more complicated models like triangle-based meshes, and try to use OpenMP to speed up.
